Back when I was in MS Customer Support found that **IE** was going out os support so **FREB* traces would not be readable under normal server browser .

For this i wrote ðŸ”­ [FrebToHMTL][FrebToHMTL] Utility to convert XML Freb traces to HTML with all features Taking IIS Failed Request Traces that need an XML and and XSL to render and converting them to a self-contained HTML.

If you want to have a look you can find it on [GITHUB][FrebToHMTL]!!
