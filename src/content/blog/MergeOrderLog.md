**PROBLEM**:

I'm a **LAZY** person so when i face scenarios where i have a bunch of logs i hate reviewing them individually.

Imagine a folder full of logs generated by [Log4Net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html), for example 10 log files from your test app.

On linux i can use **GREP** but its not easy to have other people do this or teach them to do this.

**SOLUTION**:

I wrote **MergeOrderLog** command-line application designed to process, format and/or filter log files generated. It will take all files from a directory provided via command line and will generate an end result file **_MERGED.log_** that then i can review with [TextAnalysisTool.NET](https://textanalysistool.github.io/)

**_PREREQUISITE_** : The log should start with date time value (**ex:** _2023-12-04 11:27:02.500_)

**_CommandLine_**

```code
.\MergeOrderLog.exe -p .\MyLogs\
```

This will generate the **_FINAL_FORMATTED.log_**

```code
ProcessedLogs folder created successfully.
Merged logs saved at: .\MyLogs\ProcessedLogs\MERGED.log
All processing complete.
Final file saved at: .\MyLogs\ProcessedLogs\FINAL_FORMATTED.log
```
