I'm a Escalation Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal.

I started my IT journey as a hobby/part-time job when i was studying for my Law degree.

**Realized I LOVE the hobby that i discovered and i NEVER looked back.**
 
 Worked in a lot of companies like PwC and Microsoft and had jobs across all the IT industry.
 
 I`m a softwaremechanic and i am balancing always **"mada mada dane" and "ichigo ichie"**
